# RNA-Seq-pipeline
An RNA-Seq pipeline for analysis of Arabidopsis Thaliana datasets
## Getting Started
These instructions will help you to run the RNA-Seq pipeline from linux environment
The RNA-Seq pipeline performs the following tasks:
* File conversion from SRA to FastQ
* Perform quality metric using FastQC
* Adapter and Quality Trimming
* Read Alignment using Tophat2
* Read counting using HTSeq
* Differential Gene Expression using Cufflinks
* Differential Gene Expression using DESeq
* Differential Gene Expression using edgeR
